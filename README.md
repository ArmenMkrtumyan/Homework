## How to Generate Reports

You can build both versions of the report from the **R console** using the commands below.

### Generate HTML Report
```r
rmarkdown::render(
  "Marketing_Analytics.Rmd",
  output_format = "html_document",
  output_file   = "Marketing_Analytics.html",
  output_dir    = "report"
)
```
### Generate PDF Report

rmarkdown::render(
